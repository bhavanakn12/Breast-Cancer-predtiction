# Breast-Cancer-predtiction
Smart breast cancer prediction system built with machine learning for fast and reliable diagnosis.

# Project Overview
This project is a Breast Cancer Prediction Web Application developed using Machine Learning and Streamlit. It predicts whether a breast tumor is Benign (Non-Cancerous) or Malignant (Cancerous) by analyzing medical diagnostic features from a dataset.
The application provides an interactive interface to display dataset preview, model performance, and prediction results, making it user-friendly and suitable for healthcare-related analysis

 # Project Objectives
Build a machine learning-based cancer prediction system
Provide early and accurate diagnosis support
Visualize classification performance
Create a simple web interface using Streamlit

# Machine Learning Model Used
Logistic Regression
The Logistic Regression algorithm is used for classification because it performs well for binary classification problems and provides high accuracy for medical prediction tasks

# Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix Heatmap
These metrics help in understanding prediction quality and error distribution.
